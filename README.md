# ðŸŒ´ Mine Island

A survival-oriented Spigot plugin that provides players with their own personal floating islands, allowing them to build, expand, and create a private base in a safe environment.

## Overview

Mine Island gives each player a dedicated island in a separate `islands` world, complete with structured land management, zone ownership, and upgradeable territory. The plugin integrates seamlessly with popular economy and utility plugins, offering a customizable experience for server owners and players alike.

## Features

- **Personal Islands**: Each player receives their own island to build freely.  
- **Structured Land System**: Islands are divided into **100x100 slots** with a **90x90 buildable area** in the center.  
- **Zone Ownership**: Islands are further divided into **10x10 zones** (9x9 usable). Players start with the central zone and can expand gradually.  
- **Upgradeable Land**: Players can expand their islands by purchasing additional zones via `/mineisland manage`.  
- **Configurable Economy**: Set expansion prices and define multipliers for each purchase.  
- **Plugin Integration**: Supports [Vault](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/vault.34315/) and [Essentials](https://essentialsx.net/) for full economy and utility functionality.
